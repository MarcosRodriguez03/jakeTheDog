comments: the overall design and idea of the whole website was amazing. all pages are responsive in both desktop and mobile. I like the edition of the sticky navbar, because it makes it easier to navigate. The only nitpick I can think of is for the mobile navbar, maybe there could be margin, so that the logo and hamburger aren't touching the edges. Other than that Good job!
